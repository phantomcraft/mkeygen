mkeygen - Master key generator
==============================

* Requirements: Coreutils from 2017 on, Sed and findutils (any regular 
    Linux distribution should have these packages already installed).



This is a simple script for generating master key files 
in a secure way for using with cryptsetup or any other 
encryption program that uses master key files that are 
used directly by the cipher it uses.

mkeygen takes random data from /dev/random and hashes
with b2sum utility (Blake2b hash function).

Keys larger than 512-bits of size are used in chained mode, better than
hashing each chunk taken from /dev/random separately.

Chunks gotten from /dev/random have twice the size of b2sum
output for assuring that sufficient entropy will be get 
from it.
